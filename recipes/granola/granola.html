<h2>Description</h2>
A calorie packed granola dish with almond butter. Easily substitutable by any other nut base butter. Add in any fruits you desire!

<p>
Ingredients
<ul>
    <li> 1/4 cup almond butter </li>
    <li> 1/4 cup honey </li>
    <li> 1 tsp. vanilla extract </li>
    <li> 2 cup rolled oats </li>
    <li> 1 serving vanilla protein powder (optional) </li>
    <li> 2 tbsp. ground flax </li>
    <li> 1 tsp. cinnamon </li>
    <li> 1/4 tsp. salt </li>
    <li> 1/3 cup chocolate chips </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Steps
<ol>
    <li> Preheat oven to 325F and spray a baking sheet with cooking spray or line it with parchment paper or a non-stick baking mat. Set aside. </li>

    <li> In a small saucepan over medium-low heat, add almond butter and honey, stirring until the almond butter is melted and fully combined with the honey. Stir in vanilla extract. </li>

    <li> Remove from heat and add oats, protein powder (if using), flax, cinnamon, and salt. Mix well and use a spatula to ensure that all of the oats are well coated. </li>

    <li> Spread the granola mixture over a baking sheet, leaving as many clusters as you want, and bake for 8 minutes. Remove from oven, stir, and bake for another 8 minutes, or until lightly golden. </li>

    <li> Let cool completely before adding chocolate chips and transferring to a storage container. The granola will still be slightly soft when it comes out of the oven, but it will harden up as it sits at room temperature and cools. </li>

</ol>
